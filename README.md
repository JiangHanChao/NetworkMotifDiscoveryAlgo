# NetworkMotifDiscoveryAlgo
the network motif discovery algorithm about arguments passing by command. the algorithm has WaRSwap, Rand-ESU, Comofinder, and the comofinder is implemented by Python

-------------

### We provide a command line based algorithm version.

the WaRSwap algorithm is running on software mode, but can't run with command arguments,so I provide a command version for it.

you can use it by this:

java -jar cmdmain.jar "C:\Users\Desktop\warswap\input_42_edges.txt" "C:\Users\Desktop\warswap\input_42_vtxs.txt" "3"  "C:\Users\Desktop\warswap\result.txt"  "C:\Users\Desktop\warswap\out"  "44"

the means can be see in warswap/README.txt
